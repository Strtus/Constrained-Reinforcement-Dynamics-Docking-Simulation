Qianfan Satellite Training Improvement Recommendations
=======================================================

Immediate Actions:
-----------------
1. Adjust PD controller gains (reduce kp to 0.02, increase kd to 0.5)
2. Increase maximum episode steps to 2000
3. Relax success criteria (distance < 2.0m, velocity < 0.2m/s)
4. Add distance-based reward shaping

Short-term Improvements:
-----------------------
1. Implement adaptive gain scheduling
2. Add velocity-dependent control strategy
3. Include approach angle constraints
4. Design multi-phase control sequence

Long-term Solutions:
-------------------
1. Implement reinforcement learning (PPO/SAC)
2. Add curriculum learning framework
3. Include sensor noise and actuator dynamics
4. Develop robust safety constraints

Priority Level:
- HIGH: Immediate Actions (can be implemented in 1-2 hours)
- MEDIUM: Short-term Improvements (1-3 days)
- LOW: Long-term Solutions (1-4 weeks)
